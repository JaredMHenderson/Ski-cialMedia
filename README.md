ABOUT Snow Scout:

Snow Scout was an APIs Project assignment. Instructions were as follows:

Coding Requirements

	•Must use AJAX to pull data

	•Must utilize at least one new library or technology that we haven’t discussed

	•Must have a polished frontend / UI

	•	•Utilize Firebase for Persistent Data Storage (Consider this 	basically a requirement).
	•	
	•	•Mobile Responsive
	•	
	•	•Use an alternative CSS framework like Materialize



TECH USED: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Firebase, CSS Grid Layout

HIGHLIGHT CODE:

I used CSS Grid layout to create the front end styling. I found it very convenient and easy to use.
.grid {

	

	display:grid;

	grid-gap:.5rem;

	grid-template-rows: 200px 50px 250px 250px 50px;

	grid-template-columns: 275px 275px 275px 300px;		

	grid-template-areas:

		'header header header header'

		'nav    nav    nav    srch  '

		'map    map    list   intro '

		'map    map    list   login '

		'ftr    ftr    ftr    ftr';

	

}

				.grid {

		

		grid-template-rows: 200px 50px 250px 500px 50px;

		grid-template-columns: 400px 300px;



		grid-template-areas:

			"header    header"

			"nav       srch"

			"map       intro"   

			"list      login"

			"ftr       ftr";

	}


CONCLUSION: 
	In completing this project, I learned a lot about how to create an App. I learned how to use CSS Grid layout, and Google Firebase to do User Auth. I also gained experience working in a development team.

GRADE: A+

Fantastic work guys. I thought the application looked great and operated as expected. Really good job of making an application that has use, def something I would use. Really nice interface, love the gifs etc, overall came across as really professional. Keep building on the skills you learned and progressing as we move towards Project 2.
